# Bugs

- Sunset Riders: the palettes become greenish on the menu screen
                 (switches back to normal after a few seconds in-game)

- Columns: the sega boot animation only appears in Release builds (Visual Studio specific)
           (no SEGA logo with clang either in release and debug)

- Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle: Planes are empty during the intro and in-game.

- Shadowrun: the games becomes completely glitched once the in-game menu is opened.

- The Simpsons - Bart's Nightmare: the planes take an invalid size (64*128). This occurs on
the menu screen and then in-game, which leads to a buffer overflow.

# Games that seem to wait for the Z80:

- Daffy Duck in Hollywood @1D7BC8
- The Addam's Family @43C0E
